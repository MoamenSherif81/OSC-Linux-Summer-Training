Step 1:
Used mkdir command to make new directory 
mkdir "Moamen Sherif"

Then used cd command to change the directory
cd Moamen\ Sherif

Step 2:
Used mkdir command to make new directory 
mkdir "Documents"

Then used cd command to change the directory
cd Documents

the used touch command to make the text files
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

Stemp 3:
Used cd .. to return to the parent directory

the used touch to make new file with a . at the first of the name to make it hidden
toch .hidden_file

Used ls -a to view all contents of this folder


Step 4:
used nano Documents/file1.txt to open the nano editor on the file we want

then write what we want on the file and then press ctrl+x to close the editor then y to save changes.

then used cat command to show to contents of the file

Step 5:
used cd - to return to the previous directory

Step 6:
Used mkdir - to make the new directory
then used cd ./- to navigate to this directory as we cant just say cd - because this is already a command that return us to the previes directory


Step 7:
cd ../.. to return to the main directory
cp -r Documents/ ./My_Documents to copy the directory into the same parent directory but with another name and -r to get all its content
then ls to see that the folder in created with this name 
then ls ./My_Document to check that we have all the files copied with the folder

Step 8:
cat .hidden_file to see the contents of this file but it is already empty so nothing appeared

Step 9:
used mv command to move the files from directory to another 
mv ./Documents/file1.txt ./Document/file2.txt .
this will take file1.txt and file2.txt and move then to the current directory

Step 10:
cd .. to go to the parent directory
rm -r Moamen\ Sherif to remove the folder with all its content
ls to check that the folder is removed
